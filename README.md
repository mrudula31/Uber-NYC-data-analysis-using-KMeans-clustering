Uber Technologies Inc is a peer-to-peer ride sharing platform. Uber platform connects the cab drivers who can drive to the customer location. Uber uses machine learning, from calculating pricing to finding the optimal positioning of cars to maximize profits. Used public uber trip dataset to discuss building a real-time example for analysis and monitoring of car GPS data.

You can find the Uber NYC datasets in this link :- https://data.world/data-society/uber-pickups-in-nyc

The data from New York City which has five boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Staten Island. Applied K-means Clustering on this dataset to understand the trips taken on Uber and identify different boroughs within New York.

Clustering is the process of dividing the datasets into groups, consisting of similar data-points”. Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data.

Here, we have applied a K-Means clustering algorithm whose main goal is to group similar elements or data points into a cluster. “K” in K-means represents the number of clusters.

You need to have folium package installed in your jupyter notebook or in your anaconda navigator to view the map 


To install Folium package in jupyter Notebook , run the following codes

  $ pip install folium
  
To install the same in Anaconda Navigtor

  conda install -c conda-forge folium
  
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 folium
  
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 folium
  
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 folium
